## Intorduction

This work uses 3D effects to simulate the scene of snow, and the snow flakes fall.

At the click of a button, the snowflakes change positions to the beat of a Christmas song. Every time you watch it, you will see a completely different snow scene.

In addition, in addition to the beat of the music, my code also allows you to use the mouse to control the speed and direction of the snowflakes falling.

## Requirements

Christmas is coming soon! What do you think of when you think of Christmas? Santa Claus? Christmas tree? Or a Christmas present? These are things we can see in reality if we want to.

But my dream Christmas should have snow, but snow is not something we can see whenever we want to. And it hasn't snowed in London yet. Then let's take a look at the snow that I use code.
