## Intorduction


Christmas is coming soon! What do you think of when you think of Christmas? Santa Claus? Christmas tree? Or a Christmas present? These are things we can see in reality if we want to.

But my dream Christmas should have snow, but snow is not something we can see whenever we want to. And it hasn't snowed in London yet. Then let's take a look at the snow that I use code.

Firstly, I made a sphere with 3D effects, made all the points into snowflake shapes, and then let the sphere move. When the sphere is enlarged, we can see that there are near and far snowflakes moving.When I adjust the direction of the sphere's movement, the snowflakes seem to be falling in an irregular way. In this way, the effect of snowflakes falling and being blown by the wind can be created.

In this work, when the Christmas-style button is not clicked, the snowflakes will fall freely. With the Christmas-style button, it directly creates a sense of Christmas atmosphere for users.When the user clicks the button, the beautiful Christmas carol sounds. At this time, the snowflakes will change to the rhythm of Christmas songs. Users can be immersed in music and visual effects at the same time.

## Requirements

This work uses 3D effects to simulate the scene of snow, and the snow flakes fall.

At the click of a button, the snowflakes change positions to the beat of a Christmas song. Every time you watch it, you will see a completely different snow scene.


In addition, in addition to the beat of the music, my code also allows you to use the mouse to control the speed and direction of the snowflakes falling.

## Recommended modules

·3D graphics

·Sound and Signal processing

## Detail

In the process of experimenting, I tried to use three.js to make snow animation, but the 2D effect was too simple when using pictures to add, and adding multiple snowflake pictures could not produce the falling effect. This is the effect of trying：https://mimicproject.com/code/2baac440-3185-5fa9-3ccf-f5ca5df69ddd

In the end, I chose to use the 3D effect to achieve the snowflake effect, which is more immersive. This is a trial effect of trying：https://mimicproject.com/code/fe4c9d06-1e89-a439-b5f4-55a89c2b5e1f

After making the animation effect, I thought about adding Christmas-style background music to this animation. After choosing the music, I found that the music has a clear rhythm. At this time, I think the rhythm of the music can be used to control the falling of snowflakes. Speed, so that music and pictures have a better fusion effect.
